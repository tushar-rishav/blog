Hi there!

Something was holding me back from taking the first step but finally, I’ve started writing blog. \m/

I am delighted to share the news that I’ve been recently selected as a [Google Summer of Code](http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) intern and I shall be working with [coala organisation](http://coala-analyzer.org/) under Python Software Foundation.
It all started with my participation in [IndiaHack Open Source competition](https://www.hackerearth.com/sprints/open-source-india-hacks-2016/), a month long contest during January’16 and got introduced to coala.
I still remember, within a few hours after my first message at [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/coala-analyzer/coala), I started working on an issue that was supposed to improve the coverage of coala core. Specifically, increase it from 98% to 100%. I had to first get familiar with the codebase, coala protocols like rebase - linear history, making atomic changes with good commit messages and writing a quality code. As I had just started, it was certainly a challenging task for me. But with the humble and ever supporting nature of coala developers, I got comfortable fairly soon.
I really look forward to continue as a contributor to this awesome community as a GSoC intern during summer and further.

Certainly, It has been a learning experience so far. I’ve learnt a lot since past couple of months. Getting inspired from another awesome coalaian - [Sils1297](https://github.com/sils1297), I shall be attending [EuroPython 2016](https://ep2016.europython.eu/) at Bilbao, Spain coming July. My talk, [Guide to make a real contribution to an open source project for novice](https://ep2016.europython.eu/conference/talks/guid-to-make-a-real-contribution-to-an-open-source-project-for-novice) can be seen at the website.
We also have a [sprint](https://wiki.python.org/moin/EuroPython2016/coalaSprint) planned during the conference.
Feel free to drop me a mail if you are attending the conference.

I guess that’s all for now. :)
Stay tuned for further updates!
