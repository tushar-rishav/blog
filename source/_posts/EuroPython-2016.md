I am really pumped up for the forthcoming [EuroPython](https://ep2016.europython.eu/en/) conference being held in Bilbao, Spain from July 17-24.

### [](#EuroPython-in-brief "EuroPython in brief")EuroPython in brief

The EuroPython conference series was initiated by the [European Python community](http://www.europython-society.org/) in 2002\. It started in Charleroi, Belgium, which attracted over 200 attendees and have surpassed the 1000 attendee mark in 2014\. It’s the second largest Python conference world-wide and the largest in Europe. If you are interested, you should [buy](https://ep2016.europython.eu/en/registration/) the ticket as long as they last. :)

I shall be conducting a session on a [guide to make a real contribution to an open source project for novice](https://ep2016.europython.eu/conference/talks/guid-to-make-a-real-contribution-to-an-open-source-project-for-novice) and also be accompanied by the awesome [coalains](https://github.com/coala-analyzer/) who will be attending this conference. We have a [sprint](https://wiki.python.org/moin/EuroPython2016/coalaSprint) scheduled too. :D

I am grateful to the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/) and EuroPython for sponsoring the accommodation and ticket for the conference. Without such aid it wouldn’t be possible to meet the awesome community out there. I must also pay my gratitude to [Lasse Schuirmann](https://github.com/sils1297) for encouraging and helping to make this participation actually happen. :)

Stay tuned!
