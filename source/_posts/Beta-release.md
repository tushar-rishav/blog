So finally we released coala-html [beta](https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala-html/releases/tag/v0.2.0) version. At present, coala-html generates an interactive webpage using the results obtained from coala analysis. Users can search across results, browse the files and also the particular code lines where errors were produced. Similar to a coverage tool that displays the lines being missed. At present we support Linux platform only and will add more cool features in coming releases. 

We would love to hear from you. If you have any feature proposal or if you find any bugs, please let us [know](https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala-html/issues)

Now, with coala-html released Iâ€™ve started working on coala website. Further updates in next blog!
